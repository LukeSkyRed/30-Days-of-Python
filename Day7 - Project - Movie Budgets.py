#For this project, your program should do the following:

#1 - Calculate the average budget of all movies in the data set.
#2 - Print out every movie that has a budget higher than the average you calculated.
#You should also print out how much higher than the average the movie's budget was.
#3 - Print out how many movies spent more than the average you calculated.

#If you want a little extra challenge, allow users to add more movies to the data set before running the calculations.
