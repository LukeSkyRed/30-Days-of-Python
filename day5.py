#Day 5: Conditionals and Booleans

#Write a program to determine whether an employee is owed any overtime. 
#You should ask the user how many hours the employee worked this week, as well as the hourly wage for this employee.
#If the employee worked more than 40 hours, you should print a message which says the employee is due some additional pay, 
#as well as the amount due. The additional amount owed is 10% of the employees hourly wage for each hour worked over the 40 hours.
#In effect, the employees get paid 110% of their hourly wage for any overtime.
